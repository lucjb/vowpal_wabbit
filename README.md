This is the *vowpal wabbit* fast online learning code.  For Windows, look at [README.windows.txt](./README.windows.txt)

## Prerequisite software

These prerequisites are usually pre-installed on many platforms. However, you may need to consult your favorite package
manager (*yum*, *apt*, *MacPorts*, *brew*, ...) to install missing software.

- [Boost](http://www.boost.org) library, (for `Boost::Program_Options` and a few others).
- The zlib compression library + headers. In linux distros: package `zlib-devel` (Red Hat/CentOS), or `zlib1g-dev` (Ubuntu/Debian)
- lsb-release  (RedHat/CentOS: redhat-lsb-core, Debian: lsb-release, Ubuntu: you're all set, OSX: not required)
- GNU *autotools*: *autoconf*, *automake*, *libtool*, *autoheader*, et. al. This is not a strict prereq. On many systems (notably Ubuntu with `libboost-program-options-dev` installed), the provided `Makefile` works fine.
- (optional) [git](http://git-scm.com) if you want to check out the latest version of *vowpal wabbit*,
  work on the code, or even contribute code to the main project.
- Python module `six` needs to be installed in order to run the tests.

### Vcpkg
[Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) can also be used to install the dependencies. When running cmake the toolchain needs to be supplied, this is decribed in the [compiling section](#compiling).
```
# Linux
# vcpkg cannot currently be used on Linux because boost-python fails to build on linux. [See this issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues/4603)
vcpkg install rapidjson:x64-linux
vcpkg install zlib:x64-linux
vcpkg install boost-system:x64-linux
vcpkg install boost-program-options:x64-linux
vcpkg install boost-test:x64-linux
vcpkg install boost-align:x64-linux
vcpkg install boost-foreach:x64-linux
vcpkg install boost-python:x64-linux

# Windows
vcpkg install rapidjson:x64-windows
vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-system:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-program-options:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-test:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-align:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-foreach:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-python:x64-windows
```

## Getting the code

You can download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Download).
The very latest version is always available via 'github' by invoking one of the following:

```
## For the traditional ssh-based Git interaction:
$ git clone git://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit.git

## You can also try the following SSH URL:
$ git clone git@github.com:VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit.git

## For HTTP-based Git interaction
$ git clone https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit.git
```

## Compiling

You should be able to build the *vowpal wabbit* on most systems with:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
make test    # (optional)
```

If using vcpkg for dependencies the toolchain file needs to be supplied to `cmake`:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

The CMake definition supports the following options that can be set when invoking `cmake`:
```
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - Controls base flags for building. Release includes optimization, Debug is unoptimized ([Debug|Release], default: Debug)
PROFILE - Turn on flags required for profiling ([ON|OFF], default: OFF)
VALGRIND_PROFILE - Turn on flags required for profiling with valgrind in gcc ([ON|OFF], default: OFF)
GCOV - Turn on flags required for code coverage in gcc ([ON|OFF], default: OFF)
WARNINGS - Turn on warning flags ([ON|OFF], default: ON)
STATIC_LINK_VW - Link VW executable statically ([ON|OFF], default: OFF)
VW_INSTALL - Add install targets ([ON|OFF], default: ON)
BUILD_TESTS - Build and enable tests ([ON|OFF], default: ON)
BUILD_JAVA - Add Java targets ([ON|OFF], default: Off)
BUILD_PYTHON - Add Python targets ([ON|OFF], default: Off)
BUILD_DOCS - Add documentation targets ([ON|OFF], default: Off)
```

Options can be specified at configuration time on the command line:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSTATIC_LINK_VW=ON
```

Be sure to read the wiki: https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit/wiki
for the tutorial, command line options, etc.

The 'cluster' directory has it's own documentation for cluster
parallel use, and the examples at the end of test/Runtests give some
example flags.

## C++ Optimization

The default C++ compiler optimization flags are very aggressive. If you should run into a problem, consider running `cmake` with the `Debug` build type:

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

## Ubuntu/Debian specific info

On Ubuntu/Debian/Mint and similar the following sequence should work
for building the latest from github:

```
# -- Get libboost and zlib:
apt-get install libboost-dev zlib1g-dev

# -- Get the python libboost bindings (python subdir) - optional:
apt-get install libboost-python-dev

# -- Get the vw source:
git clone git://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit.git

# -- Build:
cd vowpal_wabbit
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
make test       # (optional)
make install
```

### Ubuntu advanced build options (clang and static)

If you prefer building with `clang` instead of `gcc` (much faster build
and slighly faster executable), install `clang` and specify the compiler to be clang:

```
apt-get install clang

export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++

cmake ..
```

A statically linked `vw` executable that is not sensitive to boost
version upgrades and can be safely copied between different Linux
versions (e.g. even from Ubuntu to Red-Hat) can be built and tested with:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DSTATIC_LINK_VW=ON
make vw-bin -j
```

## Debian Python 3 Binding

Ensure boost-library and c-compiler are installed:
```
apt-get install libboost-dev zlib1g-dev libboost-python-dev clang make automake
```

Set Python 3.x and its boost-library as default:
```
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.7 1
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.x 2

ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py3x.a /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python.a
ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py3x.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python.so
```

Install Vowpal Wabbit via pip:
```
pip3 install vowpalwabbit
```

## Mac OS X-specific info

OSX requires _glibtools_, which is available via the [brew](http://brew.sh) or
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) package managers.

### Complete brew install of 8.4
```
brew install vowpal-wabbit
```
[The homebrew formula for VW is located on github](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/vowpal-wabbit.rb).

### Manual install of Vowpal Wabbit
#### OSX Dependencies (if using Brew):
```
brew install boost
brew install boost-python
```

#### OSX Dependencies (if using MacPorts):
```
## Build Boost for Mac OS X 10.8 and below
$ port install boost +no_single -no_static +openmpi +python27 configure.cxx_stdlib=libc++ configure.cxx=clang++

## Build Boost for Mac OS X 10.9 and above
$ port install boost +no_single -no_static +openmpi +python27
```

#### OSX Python Binding installation with Anaconda
When using Anaconda as the source for Python the default Boost libraries used in the Makefile need to be adjusted. Below are the steps needed to install the Python bindings for VW. This should work for Python 2 and 3. Adjust the directories to match where anaconda is installed.

```
# create anaconda environment with boost
conda create --name vw boost
source activate vw
git clone https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit.git
cd vowpal_wabbit
# edit Makefile
# change BOOST_INCLUDE to use anaconda env dir: /anaconda/envs/vw/include
# change BOOST_LIBRARY to use anaconda lib dir: /andaconda/envs/vw/lib
cd python
python setup.py install
```

## Code Documentation
To browse the code more easily, do

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_DOCS=On
make doc
```

and then point your browser to `doc/html/index.html`.

Note that documentation generates class diagrams using [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org). For best results, ensure that it is installed beforehand.


## Experimental: CMake build system on Windows
Note: The CSharp projects are not yet converted to CMake for Windows. So the CMake generated solution is only for C++ projects for the time being. For this reason the existing solution can not yet be deprecated.
### Dependencies
```
vcpkg install rapidjson:x64-windows
vcpkg install cpprestsdk:x64-windows
vcpkg install zlib:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-system:x64-windows

vcpkg install boost-test:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-align:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-foreach:x64-windows
vcpkg install boost-python:x64-windows
```

### Build
#### Windows
1. Open CMake GUI
2. Add two entries
    1. `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
    2. `VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows`
    3. `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG`
3. Configure
    1. Choose `Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64`
4. Generate
5. Open Project

Or command line:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg root>\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows
make -j
```

## Gotchas
### When using WSL (Windows Subsytem for Linux)
- If the repo is cloned in Windows and used in the Linux environment, shell scripts will have CRLF line endings and will need to be converted to work.
- A strange bug was seen that caused the `vw_jni` target to fail to build. A full fix isn't known but the following were factors:
  - CMake version 3.5.1
  - WSL Ubuntu 16.04
  - Java was installed in Windows and added to the Windows path when compiling `vw_jni`
  - Setting JAVA_HOME caused CMake to display the right dependency at configure time but the Windows files were actually used
